# Star Wars.com – Troopers

## Clone Trooper

Clone troopers fight with the Jedi to protect the galaxy! Clone troopers have this big ridge that looks like it's on a hawk. They look like they're stormtroopers but they're good.

## Stormtrooper

Millions and millions of stormtroopers fight the Jedi. Stormtroopers aren't that smart at all. They're very fast, though. They have E-11 blasters.

## Stormtrooper (different kind!)

They have more high-tech armor than the stormtroopers who used to fight for the Empire. They have a mega blaster and a blaster pistol. The blaster pistol is on its leg.

## Captain Phasma

Captain Phasma leads the First Order's stormtroopers. She has silver armor and she looks very dangerous.
